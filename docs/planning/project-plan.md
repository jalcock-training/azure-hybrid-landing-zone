- Add CI/CD automation with OIDC
- Add compliance dashboards
- Harden hybrid workloads

## Deliverables

- Fully functional Phase 1 landing zone

- Security documentation
- Terraform modules
- Hybrid workload demonstration

## Rationale

Phase 1 focuses on delivering a secure, functional, free-tier landing zone.  
Phase 2 adds enterprise-grade capabilities once the foundation is stable.
